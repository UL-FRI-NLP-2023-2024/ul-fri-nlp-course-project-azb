      "Post: I found myself conflicted for the princess. I always want a happy ending of some kind in the stories I read. However, it seems the princess loses either way in this story. If I were in her place, I would have allowed him to marry the woman rather than have him die a painful and bloody death.\n",
      "Category: Imaginative\n",
      "\n",
      "Post: Unfortunately I can't click in the box below at all, so it's anyone's guess what style our response is supposed to be in. I would imagine answering the questions simply would be fine.\n",
      "Category: UX\n",
      "\n",
      "Post: Dr. Austin said have fun with it, and it is fun to ponder what might happen in the story. I think the main reason for setting a time to discuss it at the same time would be to test the collaborative software, using the box below instead of this one. I believe we could all write in it at the same time and see each other typing and change each other's words until we all agree we are done with our assessment. If we are able to do that, we might find there are unexpected positives or negatives to the collaboration process or system that we can only otherwise surmise. As you say, we've all responded to the prompts, so what we say doesn't matter that much, so all we'd need is a few minutes to see how using the box works. So if you want to try meeting, I could do Wednesday any time of day. Just set a time and I'll log on then. Thanks.\n",

      "\n",
      "Post: I could write the first draft based on my interpretation of our answers, then we could take turns editing - round robin style until we are happy with the result\n",
      "Category: Deliberation\n",
      "\n",
      "Post: Curiosity got the best of me, and I googled this book, which I'd never heard of despite it being a well-known allegory. It presents an unsolvable problem, yet we all felt pretty confident taking a stab at answering the prompts. I wonder what we are to make of all of us feeling pretty certain the princess chose the tiger. Is our choice based on the author's characterization of her or our belief that human nature is fundamentally selfish?\n",
