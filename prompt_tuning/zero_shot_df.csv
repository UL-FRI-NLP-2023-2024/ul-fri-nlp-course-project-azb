1,4,4,Seminar,Seminar,That's what I thought to or how I interpreted the ending
2,4,4,Seminar,Seminar,Hey Ashley Peterson! I also wanted to mention the story mention the King's barbaric nature numerous times so it is highly likely that he would punish his daughter.
3,5,0,Social,Deliberation,Yes I found this by luck...LOL!
4,4,4,Seminar,Seminar,"Ana, I agree with you that the king is so adamant that his system is perfect that he would subject his daughter to it. I think he is somewhat blinded by his own importance, and feels that as king he should also be in charge of everyone's fate.  because if he truly loved her he would not have sent the one man that she loved into the arena. He would have moved mountains to make her happy"
5,4,4,Seminar,Seminar,"I certainly hoped that she was steering her lover away from the tiger, but can see how she would not want to see him with another woman based on the jealousy discussed above."
6,4,4,Seminar,Seminar,Based on the princess' description I had almost expected her to not make any motion towards the door. I assumed she would take the same 'let Fate decide' attitude as the king
7,5,4,Social,Seminar,I liked what you mentioned earlier Kyra

13,4,4,Seminar,Seminar,"Hello Sandra Coleman, I think it's a good point you made that the King did not consider his daughter's feelings when he made her lover enter the arena. It does seem that when he caught them, it was immediately understood that the lover would have to put his life on the line. For that reason and his barbaric nature that is quoted a lot, I also believe he would make his daughter face her fate in the King's arena."

19,5,4,Social,Seminar,That's a creative idea!
20,5,5,Social,Social,"Okay, cool"
21,0,4,Deliberation,Seminar,As for the second question I believe that the king would try to cover up the fact she broke the law. I only say that because if he was that mad because someone was her lover I doubt he would send her to die. He would probably rather punish her in private.
22,2,5,Other,Social,(I've been playing dnd too much and it has influenced my writing)
23,4,4,Seminar,Seminar,"Part Two: I think if the King discovered the truth and that the Princess had broken the law, she would be sent to the same fate as her lover.

24,0,4,Deliberation,Seminar,I don't think the father would put his daughter through the same system of justice. I wonder if he would even be all the upset though - because either way he is rid of the man causing him problems - either to death or to be married off to someone else.

36,4,4,Seminar,Seminar,"Part 2
I believe that when the King discovers that his daughter had broken the law by finding out what was behind the door and then signaling to her lover which one to open, he would be in infuriated. The story stated that he was extremely close to the Princess and resented her se ret relationship.  I believe that if the Princess saved her lover from the tiger, he would retry him and put a tiger behind both doors. The Story stated that the King was barbaric in nature so I feel he would make the Princess "

44,4,4,Seminar,Seminar, Would the king even entertain that idea given it is his daughter?

50,4,4,Seminar,Seminar,I also found the story confusing and I had to re-read it several times
51,4,4,Seminar,Seminar,My initial thoughts were that the princess knows what's behind each of the doors because the King had told her or she figured it out from overhearing him talk about the punishment.
52,1,4,Imaginative,Seminar,I think the king would subject her to the same law as everyone else and expect her fate to be decided in the arena.
53,4,4,Seminar,Seminar,"I also got the sense that she would point her lover to the tiger's door, but now the more that I think about it, I think she would send him to the other woman."

55,4,4,Seminar,Seminar,"This is such an unfortunate story. It looks to me that no matter the choice, all parties will be unhappy. I'd like to think that even though she did inherit some of her dad's fury, she would still try to give her lover a chance and not pick the door with the tiger. Perhaps, she doesn't want to be as cruel as her father, and in the name of love, sacrificed her fate to allow her lover to live.

However, I wonder if he will crack and pull the same trick that the princess had with her lover or if he will remain firm with his decision."
59,0,0,Deliberation,Deliberation,Or we could take turns writing out a paragraph and jump one it from the last person's response.

62,-1,4,_______________,Seminar,He sentences her to the same trial.
63,4,4,Seminar,Seminar,"While Jealousy is a strong determinate, Love is often stronger, and it would make sense to allow her lover to live out of love just as much as it would make"
64,4,4,Seminar,Seminar,I mean I think it states that the king does love the daughter at some point though.
65,4,4,Seminar,Seminar,"I agree with you Lillian Flores about it depending on someone, but I feel that it is up to the person reading the story and reflecting on the actions of the characters. In this case, the princess was jealous of the girl and she was also semi-barbaric like her father, so I feel she would have chosen the door with the tiger for the man. If I go with my own emotions, even though the author said not to base it on that, I would think that the princess would make the right choice with the right door and let him marry the man.  Although, would the man trust the princess enough and choose the same door as she indicated? So behind the right door would be the tiger.  They are both semibarbaric, so the King would most likely be disappointed at first, but either way, he got what he wanted and that was to keep his daughter away from this man. In this case, either sentence would be justice in his eyes."
66,4,4,Seminar,Seminar,"I agree with you ladies. I also think that she sends him to the tiger. She loves him fiercely, so fiercely that she cannot bear the thought of someone else having him. Jealousy can make people do ugly things and mix that in with her pure barbaric nature, it makes sense that she would choose for him to stop living versus living with someone else. Mourning would be easier than seeing the person you love happy with another, which is clear by the ways she describes her thoughts and turmoil over the situation."
67,4,4,Seminar,Seminar,"That's a really insightful point, Gina!"
68,4,4,Seminar,Seminar,That's certainly an interesting way to look at the potential of that kind of ending.
69,4,4,Seminar,Seminar,"There seems to be very little compassion or empathy displayed by the king or the princess  even when the princess thinks of her lover  she thinks of herself not necessarily him."""

82,5,5,Social,Social,Good job!
83,4,4,Seminar,Seminar,"I agree with you, Diane Gonzalez. I am convinced that the princess lead the gentleman to the door hiding the tiger. It would make a brilliant plot twist, but with the information we know about the character of the King, that can be found within the princess as well. In my mind she believes if she can't have the man, she sure does not want another woman to have him, especially someone she despises."
84,4,4,Seminar,Seminar,Hi Helen Howard! I feel this text is meant to unsettle in a way. It wasn't just the barbarism but also the mention of ancestry and blood that made me think it was fatalistic in a way. Kind of like the King and Princess were destined to act in cruel ways. I'm glad that someone else picked up on it too and I really liked your point that it does feel labeling a society in sweeping terms.
85,4,4,Seminar,Seminar,Part 1: I think the princess hints to him the door with the lover. She is described as only semi barberous and so by having her show mercy to her former lover she provides a foil of free will to the Barbarous Kings fate based judicious system.
86,6,6,UX,UX,I'm not sure what you mean by the final question. Once I put in the 4 questions it let me finish reading the last two pages.
87,4,4,Seminar,Seminar,"Part One con't: Oops, sent the rest before finishing this thought. I think the lover goes to the door on the left instead of the door on the right, thinking on her barbaric"" nature and that she'd likely betray him  and finds a lady instead of the tiger. I'm assuming even though he knows her  it would leave him in shock knowing that the Princess would want him dead if she cannot keep him to herself."""

Because of the King views himself and his daughter as royalty, I would speculate that he would come up with an  alternate punishment for his daughter . daughter above all of humanity"" and that she was the ""apple of his eye"
89,4,4,Seminar,Seminar,"I had orgininally thought that the king would either keep her secret out of love for his daughter, or out of barbaric pride that she sent her lover to his grizzly death, or a combination of the two. "
90,4,4,Seminar,Seminar,"I think so. Even though the story said he loved her so much, I think his barbaric nature would take over his reasoning"
91,4,4,Seminar,Seminar,"I feel that with the personalities traits provided to both the king and princess, she decided that death would be more appropriate than another woman, a rival, living happily with her lover. The princess was already wavering with deciding if he was faithful, so why would she give him and her rival the satisfaction? The lion seems to be the only choice for her disposition and upbringing."

93,5,3,Social,Procedure,"I am on,"
94,4,4,Seminar,Seminar, in being conflicted by happily ever after and greed. I chose the tiger behind the door because the story paints her out to be extremely jealous and barbaric.

102,5,4,Social,Seminar,Good point you made Rebecca
103,2,4,Other,Seminar,"Although the King is one that like to follows the rules and has a very barbaric side, he doesn't send his daughter to the tribunal. Instead he makes her live with the agony of living without her love and while facing the fact of her character."

105,4,0,Seminar,Deliberation,"I feel the flow doesn't entirely match the original story, but I felt it was awkwardly written and okay. We can add (ending) before it?"
106,4,4,Seminar,Seminar,"My first thought was that the Princess would send her lover to the tiger (because she is like her father and seems to spend a lot more time dwelling on what would happen if he chose the door with the lady than what would happen if he got the tiger), but Michelle makes a good point - that she represents free will in opposition to her father (by finding out what was behind each door). I do think that a lot of this story rests in what the reader brings to it - whether the reader thinks that the Princess would send her lover to death or give him a life without her, depends upon the reader's perception of the world and of the context of the story, rather than just the story itself. Now, I do think that the King would alter the punishment for her daughter when he finds out that she broke the law, simply because he loves her so much and I don't think he would send her to the arena (although I think that would make a more interesting story in my opinion)."

If I ponder too long, I'll never come to a conclusion, so I'm going to write my first thoughts. I share your  he's barbaric, and he's fine doling out punishment to his own daughter, as his punishment of her lover has in effect punished her as well. take that the princess will direct the gentleman to the tiger - she's lost him either way and her jealousy and barbarism are too great. On the other hand, the text describes her and the gentleman as having one soul, which I take to mean he would know if she chose the tiger, in which case he'd choose the other door, yet he doesn't. So does that mean she didn't choose the tiger? Or that he'd rather die than be with another woman? For Part 2, I believe the king likely would not show mercy, even to his own daughter, as he has consistently relied on this method of justice"
145,4,4,Seminar,Seminar,Me too I had to reread the first couple pages several times before I understood what was going on.
146,0,4,Deliberation,Seminar,I don't think we have to agree on a single ending as both are viable. I still will go with the Lady as being behind the curtain. The King will be upset with this but will forgive his daughter. He may do something else to the boyfriend later.
147,5,4,Social,Seminar,I agree with Ashely 
148,0,4,Deliberation,Seminar,This could either cause the King to become even more barbaric or to stop these trials all together
