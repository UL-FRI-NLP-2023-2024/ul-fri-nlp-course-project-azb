8,"Hello Sandra Coleman, I think it's a good point you made that the King did not consider his daughter's feelings when he made her lover enter the arena. It does seem that when he caught them, it was immediately understood that the lover would have to put his life on the line. For that reason and his barbaric nature that is quoted a lot, I also believe he would make his daughter face her fate in the King's arena.",Seminar,Deliberation

13,That's a creative idea!,Seminar,Social
14,As for the second question I believe that the king would try to cover up the fact she broke the law. I only say that because if he was that mad because someone was her lover I doubt he would send her to die. He would probably rather punish her in private.,Seminar,Deliberation

16,"Part Two: I think if the King discovered the truth and that the Princess had broken the law, she would be sent to the same fate as her lover. Having to choose between the two  he would ultimately make her choose which door just like other so-called criminals."" doors. The King thinks himself fair and seems to care a great deal about maintaining his just"" rule and appearance. I do think that even if he loves his daughter",Seminar,Imaginative
17,I don't think the father would put his daughter through the same system of justice. I wonder if he would even be all the upset though - because either way he is rid of the man causing him problems - either to death or to be married off to someone else.,Seminar,Unknown

30, Would the king even entertain that idea given it is his daughter?,Seminar,Deliberation
31,What would happen then?,Seminar,Imaginative
32,I'm not sure. They're probably equally beautiful and just jealous :),Seminar,Social
33,I think the king would subject her to the same law as everyone else and expect her fate to be decided in the arena.,Seminar,Imaginative
34,"I also got the sense that she would point her lover to the tiger's door, but now the more that I think about it, I think she would send him to the other woman.",Seminar,Unknown
35,"As for the King, he will likely send his daughter to face the same punishment as her lover. As a King, he should treat all lawbreaking the same.

56,"I think she tells him to go to the right but he goes to the left, finding the lady behind the door. In that moment realizes that she led him to his death. The Princess then has to face the fact that he found out she would rather see him dead than with the lady.",Seminar,Imaginative

63,I honestly donâ€™t think the king would have done anything after discovering his daughter broke the law. He probably covered it up or considered her already punished through her lovers fate.,Seminar,Unknown

77,I don't think we have to agree on a single ending as both are viable. I still will go with the Lady as being behind the curtain. The King will be upset with this but will forgive his daughter. He may do something else to the boyfriend later.,Seminar,Deliberation
