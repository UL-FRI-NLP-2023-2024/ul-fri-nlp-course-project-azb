0,2,5,Other,Social,Glad you like that idea 
1,5,3,Social,Procedure,"I am on,"
2,6,4,UX,Seminar, in being conflicted by happily ever after and greed. I chose the tiger behind the door because the story paints her out to be extremely jealous and barbaric.
3,5,4,Social,Seminar,"Oh, sorry! Yes I read it"
4,1,5,Imaginative,Social,"Kyra, I LOVE what you did for part 1!! "
5,1,1,Imaginative,Imaginative,does this mean we are barbaric too?
6,6,4,UX,Seminar,"Whether or not the princess 'saved' him away from the tiger, she interferred and the kind would not allow that."
7,5,3,Social,Procedure,"Perfect, we are all here."
8,6,4,UX,Seminar,The story also leads me to think that she is accustomed to having her every wish granted by her father and that she never learned the benefits of compassion.
9,6,4,UX,Seminar," Sadly  the barbaric nature of the king and princess is still alive today in crimes of passion."""
10,6,4,UX,Seminar,Good point you made Rebecca
11,1,4,Imaginative,Seminar,"Although the King is one that like to follows the rules and has a very barbaric side, he doesn't send his daughter to the tribunal. Instead he makes her live with the agony of living without her love and while facing the fact of her character."
12,6,6,UX,UX,So did I. Do you think they are in another course?
13,6,0,UX,Deliberation,"I feel the flow doesn't entirely match the original story, but I felt it was awkwardly written and okay. We can add (ending) before it?"
14,1,4,Imaginative,Seminar,"My first thought was that the Princess would send her lover to the tiger (because she is like her father and seems to spend a lot more time dwelling on what would happen if he chose the door with the lady than what would happen if he got the tiger), but Michelle makes a good point - that she represents free will in opposition to her father (by finding out what was behind each door). I do think that a lot of this story rests in what the reader brings to it - whether the reader thinks that the Princess would send her lover to death or give him a life without her, depends upon the reader's perception of the world and of the context of the story, rather than just the story itself. Now, I do think that the King would alter the punishment for her daughter when he finds out that she broke the law, simply because he loves her so much and I don't think he would send her to the arena (although I think that would make a more interesting story in my opinion)."
15,6,6,UX,UX,I can't see when people are online but I can see that you've checked the book recently
16,2,4,Other,Seminar,...
17,6,4,UX,Seminar,This action seems indicitive of her barbaric and jealous nature because this way she remains the conquerer  and if she cannot
18,1,4,Imaginative,Seminar,I agree that the princess could just banish the new couple away too. Do we have to agree on a single ending?
19,6,4,UX,Seminar,"however, she only comments that a tiger would bring shrieks and blood. From her revealed thoughts, she is "
20,6,4,UX,Seminar,I guess the ending depends on how everyone interprets it
21,1,4,Imaginative,Seminar,"I think she tells him to go to the right but he goes to the left, finding the lady behind the door. In that moment realizes that she led him to his death. The Princess then has to face the fact that he found out she would rather see him dead than with the lady."
22,1,4,Imaginative,Seminar,"Interesting Jennifer Gonzalez that I initially thought the Tiger because of her jealousy and that if she could not have him, then no one could have him. But, I changed my mind with the hope of a happier ending."
23,5,5,Social,Social,Ahhh I love your response too!
24,6,0,UX,Deliberation,I don't think I should have gone outside this platform to Google the book since this is supposed to be a discussion between us via this platform. Sorry about that.
25,6,4,UX,Seminar,"If the secret was shared with the community, I also think that it would be her informant that would be punished."
26,1,4,Imaginative,Seminar,"Anna Jones, this is what I was thinking. If you really loved him you wouldnâ€™t allow that. Alexandra, I was leaning toward the tiger at first because of the descriptions you gave. The apple doesnâ€™t fall far from the tree and all that. ðŸ™‚"
27,6,3,UX,Procedure,I did this assignment twice last semester. I think they are just trying to get feedback on how it works/doesn't work. If the prompts and/or grouping is sufficient.
28,6,4,UX,Seminar, I'm definitely okay with another approach that we can all agree on
29,6,5,UX,Social,Thank you team!  Nice collab!
30,6,6,UX,UX,Yeah I was wondering because when I click 'My Answer' at the top it says I haven't submitted one. 
31,1,4,Imaginative,Seminar, I think that she may dislike the idea that he marries another more than him dying.
32,6,4,UX,Seminar,had great grief over her lover in anotherâ€™s arms.
33,1,4,Imaginative,Seminar,I honestly donâ€™t think the king would have done anything after discovering his daughter broke the law. He probably covered it up or considered her already punished through her lovers fate.
34,6,4,UX,Seminar,she would send him to his death.
35,6,3,UX,Procedure,"I read the story and I am ready for discussion too. Let's decide on a mutual time for this. Thanks,"
36,1,0,Imaginative,Deliberation,Live Without Him is probably the most important question
37,2,4,Other,Seminar,I have never heard this story before... and I was wondering if it is some kind of folk tale?  Has anyone else seen this story before and do you know what culture it is from?
38,6,4,UX,Seminar,I'm also okay with either ending for Part 1 as well. 
39,2,6,Other,UX,"Oh, yeah! You make up the questions and then can advance!"
40,1,4,Imaginative,Seminar,She's definitely her father's child.
41,6,0,UX,Deliberation,Any additions?
42,6,0,UX,Deliberation,Should we write it as continuing the story or just as a normal response?
43,5,3,Social,Procedure,I couldn't either.
44,1,4,Imaginative,Seminar,"I think that she sends her lover to another woman. Even though the thought of him being with someone else is devastating, I don't think she could handle knowing that she  I was secretly hoping that the Princess would find a way to be the woman behind the door that I can't see her just setting him up to die! I think that the King would put his daughter through the system caused his death. I agree with the idea that we will all bring our own ideas to how we interpret the story; I have always been a Disney fantasyland"" sort of girl- true love conquers all and all that other stuff. But she took such a risk to love him  even if that meant changing his rules about who could court his daughter. As I was reading the story  defying her father and choosing true love over being a princess!"""
45,6,6,UX,UX,I don't think this e-book times out so we should be ok
46,5,5,Social,Social,Okay Hi Rebecca and Katie
47,6,6,UX,UX,"Does anyone have any idea how to ""add the title SUBMITTED"" to our response?"
48,6,6,UX,UX,"I thought we could all answer the questions in the messaging area (like you & I did), then we can take turns drafting a group response"
49,6,0,UX,Deliberation,we should keep it simple
50,6,4,UX,Seminar,that the emphasis on barbarism implies that she sent him to the lion.
51,2,4,Other,Seminar,But I'm not sure how this princess would think.
52,1,4,Imaginative,Seminar,"Hi Diane Gonzalez and Deborah Evans. I'm sorry to be so late joining the conversation. If I ponder too long, I'll never come to a conclusion, so I'm going to write my first thoughts. I share your  he's barbaric, and he's fine doling out punishment to his own daughter, as his punishment of her lover has in effect punished her as well. take that the princess will direct the gentleman to the tiger - she's lost him either way and her jealousy and barbarism are too great. On the other hand, the text describes her and the gentleman as having one soul, which I take to mean he would know if she chose the tiger, in which case he'd choose the other door, yet he doesn't. So does that mean she didn't choose the tiger? Or that he'd rather die than be with another woman? For Part 2, I believe the king likely would not show mercy, even to his own daughter, as he has consistently relied on this method of justice"
53,6,4,UX,Seminar,Me too I had to reread the first couple pages several times before I understood what was going on.
54,6,4,UX,Seminar,I don't think we have to agree on a single ending as both are viable. I still will go with the Lady as being behind the curtain. The King will be upset with this but will forgive his daughter. He may do something else to the boyfriend later.
55,6,4,UX,Seminar,I agree with Ashely 
56,6,4,UX,Seminar,This could either cause the King to become even more barbaric or to stop these trials all together
57,1,4,Imaginative,Seminar,"I think the lady is behind the door. Regardless of how jealous you may be, you can't really love someone and also be able to tolerate watching them get torn apart by a wild animal."
58,6,0,UX,Deliberation,Hey guys I got through the next page
59,6,4,UX,Seminar,"Hi Anne Lee. Yes, the reader will certainly bring her or his background and ideas to the story. And the king did indeed get what he wanted. Good points!"
60,6,5,UX,Social,"I know, I've been waiting my the computer"
61,3,5,Procedure,Social,Looks good! I guess we can complete the post survey and submit our assignment
62,1,4,Imaginative,Seminar,"Though, I do think it would have been particularly interesting to see her point him to the tiger, just for the tiger to not eat him by some stroke of luck. Perhaps the universe truly showing that the innocent go unpunished in this king's model of justice"
63,6,4,UX,Seminar,"So if the King puts his daughter on trial, does that mean he sets her up with 2 doors as well?"
64,6,6,UX,UX,I'm in google chrome
65,6,4,UX,Seminar,I honestly found the writing style in the story kind of confusing?
66,6,4,UX,Seminar,"She exhibits immaturity and cruelty by fixating on imagined flirtations between ""the lady"" and the princess's lover."
67,6,4,UX,Seminar,"Without someone seeing her give the signal, they really cannot accuse her of helping him"
68,2,4,Other,Seminar,I could be wrong but I think the daughter's door opened up to being with her lover?
69,2,4,Other,Seminar,I like it...
70,6,4,UX,Seminar,"I feel that it would be fitting for the king to sentence her to the same trial, because they king and princess are both constantly described as semi-barbaric"" throughout the text."
71,6,4,UX,Seminar,I agree Linda Long. It makes logical sense as a conclusion based on previous events in the story.
72,6,4,UX,Seminar,"Part Two:  I believe the King would send his daughter to the tribunal, because even though he loves her and she is the apple of his eye, he is illustrated to be set in his ways.  He would not make an exception for her because he feels that he needs to establish his power over the citizens of the kingdom.  If he subjects his daughter to the same punishment, then he is proving his stance and making an example of her to his kingdom.  I believe she would find a way to outwit the King, maybe with the help of her lover who she granted life to in part one."
73,5,5,Social,Social,:D
74,1,1,Imaginative,Imaginative,What would you do in her place?
75,2,5,Other,Social,Good morning
76,6,4,UX,Seminar,"That is a good point, Victoria"
77,6,4,UX,Seminar,I had not considered Ashley's idea that this experience might be an 
78,1,1,Imaginative,Imaginative, It would hurt worse to know his death was my fault than to know that he was happy with someone else. 
79,6,0,UX,Deliberation,Which questions? like the prompt?
80,1,4,Imaginative,Seminar,"But I think he would also revel in the fact that his daughter could be so barbaric. However, he does seem to hold the random chance of fate of the arena in the highest regard so although he loves his daughter above all else I think he may make an example of her. Especially if the people found out what happened"
81,6,4,UX,Seminar,I definitely agree with all of you stating that the king likely would subject his daughter to the same form of judgement in the arena if her actions were discovered.
82,2,4,Other,Seminar,acce
83,2,3,Other,Procedure,Do we know how many people are part of this group? 
84,5,4,Social,Seminar,it's wonderful!
85,6,4,UX,Seminar,Do you think the lady is more beautiful than the princess?
86,1,4,Imaginative,Seminar,"If she really loves him, she should want him to be with someone else and alive rather than dead!"
87,1,4,Imaginative,Seminar,The Lady was behind the door.
88,1,1,Imaginative,Imaginative,"Not what do you think she would do, but what would you do if you were in the situation? "
89,5,0,Social,Deliberation,ok
90,1,0,Imaginative,Deliberation,"Live without was the first one I put.  Then Trust, Love, and then Know"
91,5,6,Social,UX,ooooh
