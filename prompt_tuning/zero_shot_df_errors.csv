11,That's a creative idea!,Seminar,Social
12,As for the second question I believe that the king would try to cover up the fact she broke the law. I only say that because if he was that mad because someone was her lover I doubt he would send her to die. He would probably rather punish her in private.,Seminar,Deliberation

14,I don't think the father would put his daughter through the same system of justice. I wonder if he would even be all the upset though - because either way he is rid of the man causing him problems - either to death or to be married off to someone else.,Seminar,Deliberation

27,What would happen then?,Seminar,Imaginative
28,I'm not sure. They're probably equally beautiful and just jealous :),Seminar,Social
29,I think the king would subject her to the same law as everyone else and expect her fate to be decided in the arena.,Seminar,Imaginative
30,"As for the King, he will likely send his daughter to face the same punishment as her lover. As a King, he should treat all lawbreaking the same. However, I wonder if he will crack and pull the same trick that the princess had with her lover or if he will remain firm with his decision.",Seminar,Deliberation

67,we should keep it simple,Deliberation,Other
68,But I'm not sure how this princess would think.,Seminar,Imaginative
69,I don't think we have to agree on a single ending as both are viable. I still will go with the Lady as being behind the curtain. The King will be upset with this but will forgive his daughter. He may do something else to the boyfriend later.,Seminar,Deliberation

80,"Part Two:  I believe the King would send his daughter to the tribunal, because even though he loves her and she is the apple of his eye, he is illustrated to be set in his ways.  He would not make an exception for her because he feels that he needs to establish his power over the citizens of the kingdom.  If he subjects his daughter to the same punishment, then he is proving his stance and making an example of her to his kingdom.  I believe she would find a way to outwit the King, maybe with the help of her lover who she granted life to in part one.",Seminar,Imaginative

85,"But I think he would also revel in the fact that his daughter could be so barbaric.
